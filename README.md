## Database Schema
The database is designed following normalization principles, including:
- **1NF (First Normal Form)**
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**
- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**

## ER Diagram
An Entity-Relationship diagram is used to model the relationships between different entities in the system.

## SQL Queries
